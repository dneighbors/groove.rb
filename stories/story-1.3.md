# Story 1.3: Spotify Song Search and Matching

Status: Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want the system to find songs on Spotify based on artist/song names,
so that I don't have to manually search for each song.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Spotify API Search**: Search Spotify API for songs using artist and title
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle slight name variations and typos
3. **Multiple Artists**: Handle songs with multiple artists (featuring, collaborations)
4. **Confidence Scores**: Return confidence scores for search matches
5. **Not Found Handling**: Gracefully handle songs not found on Spotify
6. **Search Optimization**: Use best search strategies for accurate results
7. **Rate Limiting**: Handle Spotify API rate limits appropriately
8. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for API failures

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Spotify Search API Integration** (AC: 1, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Implement Spotify Web API search endpoint integration
  - [ ] Add authentication token handling for API calls
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting and retry logic
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API failures

- [ ] **Task 2: Search Strategy Implementation** (AC: 2, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Implement multiple search strategies (exact, fuzzy, partial)
  - [ ] Add artist name normalization and cleaning
  - [ ] Handle multiple artist formats (feat., featuring, &, vs)
  - [ ] Implement search result ranking and scoring

- [ ] **Task 3: Confidence Scoring System** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement confidence scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Score based on artist name match accuracy
  - [ ] Score based on song title match accuracy
  - [ ] Score based on popularity and metadata

- [ ] **Task 4: Integration with File Parser** (AC: 1-8)
  - [ ] Connect search functionality with parsed song data
  - [ ] Implement batch search for multiple songs
  - [ ] Add search result caching for performance
  - [ ] Handle mixed results (found/not found songs)

- [ ] **Task 5: CLI Integration** (AC: 1-8)
  - [ ] Add search commands to CLI
  - [ ] Display search results with confidence scores
  - [ ] Show not found songs clearly
  - [ ] Add search statistics and reporting

- [ ] **Task 6: Testing** (AC: 1-8)
  - [ ] Unit tests for search strategies
  - [ ] Integration tests with Spotify API (mocked)
  - [ ] Test fuzzy matching algorithms
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Test confidence scoring accuracy

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **Component**: `Groove::SpotifySearch` module
- **Dependencies**: `faraday` for HTTP, `oauth2` for authentication
- **Caching**: In-memory cache for search results to avoid duplicate API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Spotify API rate limits (100 requests per minute)

### Project Structure Notes
- **Search Module**: `lib/groove/spotify_search.rb`
- **Search Strategies**: `lib/groove/search_strategies/`
- **CLI Commands**: `lib/groove/search.rb` (new subcommand)
- **Tests**: `spec/groove/spotify_search_spec.rb`
- **Sample Data**: `examples/search_results.json`

### Testing Standards Summary
- **Unit Tests**: RSpec with mocked Spotify API responses
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real API (rate limited)
- **Search Tests**: Test various artist/song name variations
- **Error Tests**: Test API failures and rate limiting
