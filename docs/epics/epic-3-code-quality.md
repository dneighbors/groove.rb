# Epic 3: Code Quality & Testing Pipeline

## Epic Definition
**Title**: Implement Code Quality & Testing Pipeline
**Epic ID**: EPIC-003
**Status**: In Development
**Priority**: HIGH
**Created**: 2024-01-15
**Owner**: John (PM)

## Description
Establish automated code quality checks, testing pipeline, and pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and catch issues early in the development process.

## Business Value
- Reduce bugs and technical debt
- Improve developer productivity
- Ensure code consistency
- Enable confident refactoring
- Establish foundation for future deployment automation

## Stories

### Story 3.1: RuboCop Integration
**As a** developer
**I want** automated Ruby code style enforcement
**So that** code maintains consistent style and follows Ruby best practices

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- RuboCop gem installed and configured
- Custom configuration file created
- Integration with existing RSpec test suite
- Documentation for style guidelines

### Story 3.2: Overcommit Pre-commit Hooks
**As a** developer
**I want** pre-commit hooks that run RuboCop and tests
**So that** I catch issues before they reach the repository

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Overcommit gem installed and configured
- Pre-commit hook runs RuboCop
- Pre-commit hook runs test suite
- Hooks can be bypassed with --no-verify when needed
- Clear error messages for failed checks

### Story 3.3: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline
**As a** developer
**I want** automated testing on every push and PR
**So that** code quality is maintained in the main branch

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GitHub Actions workflow file created
- Runs on push and pull requests
- Executes RuboCop checks
- Executes full test suite
- Fails build on any errors
- Clear status reporting

### Story 3.4: Brakeman Security Scanning
**As a** developer
**I want** automated security vulnerability scanning
**So that** security issues are caught early

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Brakeman gem installed and configured
- Integrated into pre-commit hooks
- Integrated into GitHub Actions
- Security report generation
- Documentation for security practices

### Story 3.5: Test Suite Optimization
**As a** developer
**I want** an optimized test suite that runs quickly
**So that** feedback loops are fast and efficient

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Test suite runs in under 30 seconds
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Clear test output and reporting
- Integration with CI pipeline
- Documentation for testing practices

### Story 3.6: CI/Local Integration Verification
**As a** developer
**I want** consistent code quality checks running both locally and in CI
**So that** I have confidence that the same standards are enforced everywhere

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- RuboCop runs identically in both local pre-commit hooks and CI
- Brakeman runs identically in both local pre-commit hooks and CI
- CI fails build on RuboCop violations
- CI fails build on Brakeman security warnings
- Local and CI configurations are synchronized
- Clear documentation on how to run checks locally
- Performance targets met for both local and CI execution

## Implementation Priority
1. RuboCop Integration (Foundation)
2. Overcommit Pre-commit Hooks (Developer Experience)
3. GitHub Actions CI Pipeline (Automation)
4. Brakeman Security Scanning (Security)
5. CI/Local Integration Verification (Consistency)
6. Test Suite Optimization (Performance)

## Dependencies
- Ruby 3.0+
- Bundler 2.0+
- Git 2.0+
- GitHub Actions
