- **2025-10-16**: Course correction by PM: User identified usability gap - no way to list existing playlists to get IDs for `add` command. Added Story 1.7 (Playlist Discovery and Listing) to Epic 1 backlog. This will implement `groove playlist list` command to display user's playlists with IDs. Epic 1 now has 7 stories (1.1-1.7).
- **2025-10-16**: Story 1.4 enhancements completed. UX improvements: progress indicators (shows every 10 songs), improved feedback ("Found X of Y tracks"), displays missing tracks list, better final summary ("Added X of Y tracks"). Implemented automatic token refresh - users no longer need to re-authenticate hourly, refresh happens automatically in background. CRITICAL FIX: Test suite was deleting user's real config/tokens files (~/.config/groove/) after every test run - moved all test files to /tmp/groove_test/, TestAuthentication and TestConfiguration now use isolated paths. Regenerated .rubocop_todo.yml to baseline 188 existing offenses. All 124 tests passing.
