# Story 1.6: Command-Line Interface

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Core Playlist Sync (MVP)  
**Story ID:** 1.6  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Completed:** 2025-10-17  
**Story Points:** 5

## Story

**As a** user  
**I want** a simple command-line interface  
**So that** I can easily authenticate, parse files, search songs, and manage playlists

## Context

This story was implemented organically during Stories 1.1-1.4 as the CLI structure was built incrementally alongside each feature. This is retrospective documentation of the completed implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Thor-based CLI framework with organized command structure
- [x] Help system showing all available commands
- [x] Version command for displaying gem version
- [x] Executable script (`exe/groove`) for easy invocation
- [x] Subcommands organized by domain (auth, parse, search, playlist)
- [x] Clear command documentation and usage examples
- [x] Proper argument handling and validation
- [x] Colored output for better readability
- [x] Consistent command naming and structure

## Implementation Summary

### CLI Structure

**Main CLI Class (`lib/groove/cli.rb`):**
```ruby
module Groove
  class CLI < Thor
    desc 'auth SUBCOMMAND', 'Authentication commands'
    subcommand 'auth', Auth

    desc 'parse SUBCOMMAND', 'File parsing commands'
    subcommand 'parse', Parse

    desc 'search SUBCOMMAND', 'Spotify search commands'
    subcommand 'search', Search

    desc 'playlist SUBCOMMAND', 'Playlist management commands'
    subcommand 'playlist', Playlist

    desc 'version', 'Show version information'
    def version
      say "Groove v#{Groove::VERSION}"
    end

    desc 'help', 'Show help information'
    def help
      # Comprehensive help text
    end
  end
end
```

**Executable Script (`exe/groove`):**
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'groove'

Groove::CLI.start(ARGV)
```

### Command Subcommands

**Auth Commands (`lib/groove/auth.rb`):**
- `groove auth login` - Authenticate with Spotify OAuth2
- `groove auth logout` - Clear stored authentication tokens
- `groove auth status` - Check current authentication state

**Parse Commands (`lib/groove/parse.rb`):**
- `groove parse file` - Parse a single file containing songs
- `groove parse files` - Parse multiple files
- `groove parse validate` - Validate file format without processing

**Search Commands (`lib/groove/search.rb`):**
- `groove search song` - Search for a single song on Spotify
- `groove search file` - Search for all songs in a file
- `groove search stats` - Show search statistics and match rates

**Playlist Commands (`lib/groove/playlist.rb`):**
- `groove playlist create` - Create a new empty Spotify playlist
- `groove playlist add` - Add songs to existing playlist (skips duplicates)
- `groove playlist sync` - Create playlist and add songs in one operation

### Features

**Help System:**
- Comprehensive help text accessible via `groove help`
- Shows all commands with descriptions
- Includes usage examples
- Links to documentation

**Version Information:**
- `groove version` displays current gem version
- Useful for troubleshooting and support

**User Experience:**
- Colored output using Thor's `say` with color codes
- Visual indicators (✅, ❌, ⚠️) for status
- Progress feedback during operations
- Clear error messages with context

**Command Organization:**
- Logical grouping by domain (auth, parse, search, playlist)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Intuitive command hierarchy
- Easy to extend with new features

## Technical Details

**Framework:** Thor 1.3.0 (Ruby CLI framework)

**Files Implementing CLI:**
- `lib/groove/cli.rb` - Main CLI entry point with subcommands
- `lib/groove/auth.rb` - Authentication command implementations
- `lib/groove/parse.rb` - File parsing command implementations
- `lib/groove/search.rb` - Search command implementations
- `lib/groove/playlist.rb` - Playlist management command implementations
- `exe/groove` - Executable entry point

**Thor Features Used:**
- Subcommands for command organization
- `desc` for command descriptions
- `option` for command-line flags (e.g., `--name`, `--playlist-id`)
- `say` for colored output
- Built-in help generation

**Command Arguments:**
- File paths for parse/search operations
- Playlist names and IDs for playlist operations
- Optional flags for behavior customization
- Proper validation and error handling

## Command Examples

```bash
# Authentication
groove auth login
groove auth status
groove auth logout

# File Parsing
groove parse file uber_vibes_day_list.txt
groove parse validate example.csv

# Search
groove search song "Bohemian Rhapsody" "Queen"
groove search file my_songs.txt
groove search stats

# Playlist Management
groove playlist create --name "My Awesome Mix"
groove playlist add --file songs.txt --playlist-id abc123
groove playlist sync --file songs.txt --name "New Playlist"

# Utilities
groove version
groove help
```

## Testing

CLI commands are tested in:
- `spec/groove/cli_spec.rb` - Main CLI structure and routing
- `spec/groove/authentication_spec.rb` - Auth command behavior
- `spec/groove/file_parser_spec.rb` - Parse command behavior
- `spec/groove/playlist_manager_spec.rb` - Playlist command behavior
- `spec/groove/spotify_search_spec.rb` - Search command behavior

**Test Coverage:** All CLI commands have corresponding specs testing success and failure paths

## Notes

**Organic Implementation:** The CLI structure was built progressively during Stories 1.1-1.4:
- Story 1.1: Added `auth` subcommands
- Story 1.2: Added `parse` subcommands
- Story 1.3: Added `search` subcommands
- Story 1.4: Added `playlist` subcommands

**Benefits of Incremental Approach:**
- CLI tested with real features as they were built
- User experience refined iteratively
- Natural command structure emerged from actual use
- No "big bang" CLI implementation risk
- Immediate usability during development

**Design Decisions:**
- Thor chosen for robust CLI framework with good help/docs
- Subcommands used for logical organization (not flat namespace)
- Consistent verb-noun pattern across commands
- Visual feedback prioritized for better UX
- Exit codes follow Unix conventions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future stories:
- Configuration file support for default options
- Verbose/quiet modes for output control
- JSON output mode for scripting
- Batch operations for multiple files
- Interactive mode for guided workflows
