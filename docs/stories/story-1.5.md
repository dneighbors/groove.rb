# Story 1.5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Core Playlist Sync (MVP)  
**Story ID:** 1.5  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (Retrospective Documentation)  
**Completed:** 2025-10-17  
**Story Points:** 3

## Story

**As a** user  
**I want** clear feedback about what happened during sync operations  
**So that** I know which songs were added, which failed, and why

## Context

This story was implemented organically during Stories 1.1-1.4 as error handling and user feedback were built incrementally alongside each feature. This is retrospective documentation of the completed implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Custom error classes for each module (Authentication, FileParser, PlaylistManager, SpotifySearch)
- [x] Specific error types for common failure modes (TokenExpiredError, FileNotFoundError, RateLimitError, etc.)
- [x] User-friendly error messages with clear, actionable feedback
- [x] Visual feedback using emojis (‚úÖ success, ‚ùå error, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning)
- [x] Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors)
- [x] Progress indicators for long-running operations
- [x] Detailed reporting of operation results (success/failure counts)
- [x] Missing tracks are identified and reported to users
- [x] API errors are caught and presented with helpful context

## Implementation Summary

### Error Classes Implemented

**Base Error:**
```ruby
module Groove
  class Error < StandardError; end
end
```

**Module-Specific Errors:**
- `Authentication::Error` with subtypes: `TokenExpiredError`, `AuthenticationError`
- `FileParser::Error` with subtypes: `FileNotFoundError`, `InvalidFormatError`, `EncodingError`, `ValidationError`
- `PlaylistManager::Error` with subtypes: `PlaylistNotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`, `PlaylistError`
- `SpotifySearch::Error` with subtypes: `SearchError`, `RateLimitError`

### User Feedback Features

**Visual Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Success messages with green color
- ‚ùå Error messages with red color
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning messages for non-critical issues
- üéµ Progress indicators showing "Added 10 of 50 songs..." every 10 tracks

**Operation Reporting:**
- Shows total tracks found vs requested
- Lists missing tracks that couldn't be matched
- Displays final summary with counts
- Reports duplicate handling (skipped tracks)

**Error Handling:**
- Automatic token refresh when expired (no user re-authentication needed)
- Graceful handling of API rate limits
- Clear messages for file parsing issues
- Proper encoding detection and error recovery

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/groove/error.rb` - Base error class
- `lib/groove/authentication.rb` - Auth error handling and token refresh
- `lib/groove/file_parser.rb` - File parsing errors and warnings
- `lib/groove/playlist_manager.rb` - Playlist operation errors
- `lib/groove/spotify_search.rb` - Search error handling
- `lib/groove/playlist.rb` - CLI output formatting with errors
- `lib/groove/auth.rb` - Auth command error display
- `lib/groove/parse.rb` - Parse command error display

**Key Features:**
1. **Error Propagation:** Errors bubble up appropriately with context
2. **Exit Codes:** Commands exit with proper codes for scripting
3. **User-Friendly:** Technical errors translated to user-understandable messages
4. **Actionable:** Error messages suggest next steps when possible
5. **Non-Intrusive:** Warnings don't stop execution, errors do

## Testing

All error handling is covered by RSpec tests:
- `spec/groove/authentication_spec.rb` - Token expiry and auth errors
- `spec/groove/file_parser_spec.rb` - File parsing and validation errors
- `spec/groove/playlist_manager_spec.rb` - Playlist operation errors
- `spec/groove/spotify_search_spec.rb` - Search error handling

**Test Coverage:** Error handling paths are fully tested with mocked failure scenarios

## Notes

**Organic Implementation:** This functionality was built incrementally during Stories 1.1-1.4 rather than as a separate story. This approach follows best practices:
- Error handling added when implementing each feature
- Immediate user feedback during development
- Iterative improvement based on actual usage
- Natural integration with existing code

**Benefits of Approach:**
- No refactoring needed to "add error handling later"
- More maintainable code (errors handled at source)
- Better developer experience during implementation
- Real-world tested as features were built

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Error classes implemented and tested
- [x] User feedback working across all commands
- [x] Exit codes properly set
- [x] Tests passing with error coverage
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Retrospective documentation complete
