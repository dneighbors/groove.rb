## Description, Context and Goals

A Ruby gem/script that automates Spotify playlist creation and management by syncing text lists of songs/artists, with future AI conversation capabilities for music discovery and playlist building.

### Deployment Intent

MVP for early users - starting as a command-line tool/gem for personal use, expanding to web interface for broader adoption.

### Context

Currently, creating Spotify playlists requires manually searching and adding songs one-by-one through the web interface, which is time-consuming and inefficient. This is particularly painful for users who spend long hours listening to music (drivers, athletes, etc.) and want to quickly build "vibed" playlists or discover new music.

### Goals

1. **Automate playlist creation** - Sync text lists of songs/artists to Spotify playlists
2. **Enable music discovery** - AI conversation to help build and modify playlists
3. **Save time** - Eliminate manual song-by-song playlist building

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR001:** Upload text file with artist/song pairs to create new Spotify playlist
**FR002:** Update existing Spotify playlist from text file with artist/song pairs
**FR003:** Handle song matching when exact artist/song names don't match Spotify's database
**FR004:** Provide feedback on which songs were found/not found during sync
**FR005:** Support common text file formats (CSV, plain text, JSON)
**FR006:** Authenticate with Spotify API using OAuth2
**FR007:** Create Spotify playlist with custom name and description
**FR008:** Handle duplicate songs in playlist (skip or add based on user preference)
**FR009:** Support both public and private playlist creation
**FR010:** Provide command-line interface for file upload and sync operations
**FR011:** AI conversation interface for playlist building (future iteration)
**FR012:** AI-powered music discovery and recommendations (future iteration)
**FR013:** Web interface for broader user adoption (future iteration)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR001:** Process playlists with up to 100 songs within 30 seconds
**NFR002:** Handle Spotify API rate limits gracefully
**NFR003:** Provide clear error messages for authentication and API failures
**NFR004:** Support offline mode for playlist preparation (sync when connected)
**NFR005:** Maintain user's Spotify credentials securely

## User Journeys

### Primary User Journey: Driver Creating Workout Playlist

1. **Preparation**: Driver has a text file with workout songs from various sources
2. **Upload**: Driver runs `groove sync workout-songs.txt --playlist "Morning Workout"`
3. **Processing**: Tool authenticates with Spotify, creates playlist, matches songs
4. **Feedback**: Tool reports "23/25 songs added successfully, 2 not found"
5. **Result**: Driver has new Spotify playlist ready for their shift

### Future Journey: AI-Assisted Discovery

1. **Conversation**: User chats with AI about music preferences and mood
2. **Generation**: AI suggests playlist of songs based on conversation
3. **Review**: User reviews AI-generated song list
4. **Sync**: User syncs AI-generated list to Spotify playlist
5. **Iteration**: User refines playlist through continued AI conversation

## UX Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Command-line tool should be intuitive for non-technical users
2. **Clear Feedback** - Always show what happened (songs found/not found)
3. **Graceful Degradation** - Handle API failures and partial matches gracefully
4. **Future-Ready** - Design for easy expansion to web interface
5. **Privacy-Focused** - Secure handling of Spotify credentials and user data

## Epics

### Epic 1: Core Playlist Sync (MVP)
- Story 1: Spotify API authentication and setup
- Story 2: Text file parsing and song extraction
- Story 3: Spotify song search and matching
- Story 4: Playlist creation and song addition
- Story 5: Error handling and user feedback
- Story 6: Command-line interface implementation

### Epic 2: AI Music Discovery (Future)
- Story 7: AI conversation interface for playlist building
- Story 8: Music recommendation engine integration
- Story 9: Playlist modification through AI conversation
- Story 10: Web interface for AI chat functionality

*Note: Epic 2 stories will be detailed in future iterations*

## Out of Scope

- **Web interface** - Phase 2 feature
- **Multiple streaming services** - Spotify-only for MVP
- **Real-time collaboration** - Single-user tool initially
- **Advanced music analysis** - Basic matching only
- **Social features** - No sharing or collaboration initially
- **Mobile app** - Command-line and web only
